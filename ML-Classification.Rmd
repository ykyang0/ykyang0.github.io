ðŸš¨**This was a project based on real data from a hotel in Portugal.**

<br><br><br>

### 1. Goal
  + The objective was to construct a prediction model for hotel cancellations using customers' reservation features.

<br>

### 2. Methodology
  
  + Commonly used classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Ensemble Learning, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural Network and XGBoost were employed.
  
  + After performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost regression yielded the best results.

<br>

### 3. Insights

  + The following factors were found to be significant in determining the likelihood of a reservation being canceled:

      + The guest's nationality (Portuguese guests tended to cancel more frequently, possibly due to being local customers).
      + Lead time between booking and check-in (longer lead times were associated with higher cancellation rates).
      + Total number of special requests made by the customers (higher number of special requests was associated with lower cancellation rates).
      + The presence of previous non-canceled reservations (customers with such reservations had a lower tendency to cancel).
