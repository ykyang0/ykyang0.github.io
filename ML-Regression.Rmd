ðŸš¨**This project involved analyzing Uber and Lyft ride data along with supplementary climate data.**

<br><br><br>

### 1. Goal
  + To build a prediction model of the rideshare prices with the features of rides. 

<br>

### 2. Methodology

  + To obtain a preliminary assessment of the models' performance, AutoML was initially executed on a subset of the data comprising 10% due to computational constraints.
  
  + The complete dataset was used to fit the following machine learning models: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Network. Of these, XGBoost regression yielded the best performance.

<br>

### 3. Insights

  + The analysis revealed that distance, surge_multiplier, and ride type were significant features that influenced the price.
  
  + Although climate data was included in the dataset, the analysis revealed that it had minimal impact.
